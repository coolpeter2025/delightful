# Vercel Build Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. Invalid configuration in next.config.js
   - Removed unrecognized `isrMemoryCacheSize` option in the experimental section
   - This was causing the warning: "Invalid next.config.js options detected: Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'isrMemoryCacheSize'"

2. React hooks usage in the contact page
   - Fixed the contact page component by properly declaring it as a client component with arrow function syntax
   - Added missing default export at the end of the file
   - This resolves the error: "TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')"

## Explanation

The main issue was that the contact page was using React hooks during server-side rendering, which isn't supported. 
Even though the page had the "use client" directive at the top, the way the component was declared and exported
needed to be updated to ensure it's properly recognized as a client component.

These changes ensure that:
1. All React hooks are only used in client components
2. The Next.js configuration only uses recognized options
3. The contact page will now render properly in production builds
